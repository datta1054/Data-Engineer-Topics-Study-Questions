# 💡 What Attracts Me to Your Company & This Role

---

## ✨ TL;DR (One Crisp Line)

> “I want to build scalable data platforms that directly accelerate product decisions — and your company’s product and data maturity make this role a perfect fit.”  
> *(short pause)*

---

## 🎤 Full Spoken Script (1.5–2 minutes)

> “There are three things that genuinely attract me to this role and to [Company X].  
> *(pause)*
>
> **First, the product focus.**  
> *(slightly upbeat)*  
> I’m motivated by environments where data engineering directly informs product decisions — and from what I’ve read, [Company X] uses data deeply to iterate on product features and measure user impact. I thrive in that loop: build the pipeline → deliver reliable metrics → enable fast product experiments.  
> *(pause; smile slightly)*
>
> **Second, the technical challenge and scale.**  
> *(lower tone — serious)*  
> I’ve worked on migrations and observability at enterprise scale — for example, ZDART required parity for global supply-chain reports and robust governance. I’m excited by the prospect of working on systems that must scale across many teams and high query volumes.  
> *(short pause)*
>
> **Third, the cross-functional culture.**  
> *(warm tone)*  
> In my experience the best outcomes come when engineering, product and analytics collaborate closely — that’s where my cost-optimization and SRE work succeeded: I made technical changes but also built governance and reporting that product owners adopted. If [Company X] values that same collaboration, I see a strong fit.  
> *(pause)*
>
> Finally, this role aligns with where I want to grow: deeper ownership of platform reliability and influencing product roadmaps through data. I’m eager to bring my experience with Databricks, BigQuery, and observability to a product-centric engineering team and learn from the challenges here.  
> *(finish with steady, confident tone)*”

## 🎯 Delivery & Emphasis Notes

- Start with “three things” — humans like numbered lists (clear mental model).
- Each point gets a slight tonal pattern: introduce (brief rise), example (steady), impact (drop tone).
- When referencing company specifics: say them with a touch of curiosity (“from what I’ve read…”) — shows respect and humility.

---

## 📝 Customization Checklist (Before Interview)

- Replace [Company X] with the company name and one specific product/metric you admire (e.g., “your real-time recommendation engine” or “your growth of X% month-over-month”).
- If you can find a recent data-related public talk, paper, or blog from the company, mention it briefly: “I liked your engineering blog post about X” — it signals homework.

## 🗣️ Where to Pause / Breathe

> “First, the product focus. / (breath) / I’m motivated by environments where data engineering directly informs product decisions. / (short pause)”

## 🔑 What to Highlight (Keywords)

- “product focus”
- “scale”
- “governance”
- “cross-functional”
- “ownership”
- “platform reliability”

---

## 🚫 What to Avoid

- Don’t say “I want to join because of salary/benefits” or name-drop perks.
- Avoid generic flattery (“you’re the best company”) — be precise and evidence-based.

## 💡 Likely Follow-Ups + Suggested Answers

**Q: “What would you change in our data stack?”**  
A: “I’d first learn the current pain points from engineers and product analysts. Typically I’d audit data quality, cost, and SLAs — quick wins are often observability and cost controls, while bigger wins are schema stabilization and CI/CD for models.” *(short, process-oriented answer)*

**Q: “Why not a smaller company / startup?”**  
A: “I enjoy environments where scale and cross-team collaboration amplify impact. Product-based companies provide that multiplier — changes to the platform lead to measurable product improvements.”

### 🗣️ Main Script (~5 minutes total)

> “There are a few reasons this particular opportunity really resonates with me.  
> *(pause)*  
> Let me share the top three — the product focus, the technical scale, and the collaborative culture.  
> *(list slowly, with small hand gesture if in-person)*
>
> **First, the product focus.**  
> *(slight rise in tone)*  
> I’m most energized when my work directly supports product decisions.  
> *(pause 0.5s)*  
> From what I’ve learned about your company — you use data not just for reporting, but to shape user experiences and guide product strategy.  
> *(tone: interested, respectful)*  
> That’s exactly where I want to contribute: building pipelines and governance that make those insights faster and more reliable.  
> *(pause)*
>
> **Second, the technical challenge and scale.**  
> *(lower tone — serious, confident)*  
> I’ve spent the last few years building and optimizing large-scale data platforms — for example, the ZDART migration, which handled global supply-chain data.  
> *(pause)*  
> I enjoy solving problems of scale: optimizing clusters, managing cost governance, and building CI/CD systems that let teams release faster without losing stability.  
> *(calm, deliberate tone)*  
> From what I understand, your data platform operates at a similar or even larger scale — and that’s an exciting space for me to grow technically.  
> *(pause, breathe)*
>
> **Third, the culture.**  
> *(warm tone)*  
> I’ve seen that the best results come when engineering, product, and analytics teams collaborate closely.  
> *(pause)*  
> For instance, in my cost-optimization program, success didn’t come from tuning clusters alone — it came from aligning product owners and financial stakeholders around clear cost dashboards and governance.  
> *(steady pace)*  
> That cross-functional impact is what I’m looking for next — a place where data engineers can influence both technical architecture and product direction.  
> *(pause, firm close)*
>
> And finally, this role fits where I want to grow: deeper platform ownership, more visibility into business outcomes, and a chance to learn from complex, product-scale systems.  
> *(slow down)*  
> I’d love to bring my experience with Databricks, BigQuery, and observability to help advance your platform, while continuing to evolve as an engineer who understands both data and the product behind it.  
> *(gentle smile tone)*
>
> *(short pause)*  
> “That’s what really excites me about this opportunity.”  
> *(pause 1 second, then slightly lean back — signal you’re done.)*

### 🎧 COACHING CUES

- **“Three things” phrase:** Clear enumeration helps interviewer remember structure.
- **“Product focus” section:** Energetic tone, smile in your voice.
- **“Technical scale” section:** Lower, authoritative tone; use deliberate pacing.
- **“Culture” section:** Warm tone; emphasize collaboration.
- **“That’s what really excites me…”**: Soft smile, then pause — don’t rush into silence; let interviewer speak next.
