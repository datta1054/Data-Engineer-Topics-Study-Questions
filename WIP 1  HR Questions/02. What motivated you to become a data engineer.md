# 🌟 What Motivated Me to Become a Data Engineer

---

## ✨ Opening Statement

> “I love turning messy, business-critical data into reliable, repeatable systems that let people make fast, confident decisions.”  
> *(short pause)*

---

## 🎤 Full Spoken Script (1.5–2 minutes)

> “Early in my career I was exposed to a lot of ad-hoc reporting—spreadsheets emailed around, inconsistent metrics, and analysts spending days just to validate numbers.  
> *(pause 0.6s)*  
> I found that frustrating, but also exciting—because the problem wasn’t the analysts, it was the plumbing.  
> *(soft laugh, quick breath)*
>
> So I started learning how to build that plumbing.  
> *(slightly upbeat)*  
> My first big opportunity was on **ZDART**, an on-prem to cloud migration where I moved user-facing reports to a standardized data platform.  
> *(pause; slow down on ‘ZDART’)*  
> What hooked me was the mix of disciplines: **data modeling**, **infra as code**, **CI/CD for notebooks**, and actually **validating business reports** so nothing broke for users.  
> *(pause 0.8s — let the idea of “mix” land)*
>
> Over time I realized the most satisfying wins weren’t single scripts, but systems: **observability** that shrinks MTTR, **governance** that prevents accidental cost blowouts, **automation** that turns tedious access requests into secure workflows.  
> *(tone: proud, measured)*  
> For example, in an SRE initiative I built monitoring and automated incident creation that cut investigation time — that **concrete reduction in friction** for the business is what keeps me energized.  
> *(pause; emphasize ‘concrete’ and ‘energized’)*
>
> So fundamentally, I chose data engineering because it blends engineering discipline with business impact: you get to build **reliable systems** and see real teams make better decisions — fast.  
> *(finish strong, drop tone slightly)*”

## 🎯 Delivery & Emphasis Notes

- **Opening line:** Warm, reflective — like telling a small story.
- On **“ZDART”**: Raise tone a bit to signal this is a pivotal moment. Pause after naming it.
- When saying **“mix of disciplines”**: Slow down and enumerate (data modeling, infra, CI/CD) with mini pauses.
- **Closing line:** Drop tone a notch — authoritative and satisfied.

## 🗣️ Where to Pause / Breath Marks (for practice)

> “I started learning how to build that plumbing. / (breath) My first big opportunity was on ZDART, / (breath) an on-prem to cloud migration…”

## 🔑 What to Highlight (Keywords)

- “plumbing”
- “ZDART”
- “CI/CD”
- “validation”
- “observability”
- “business impact”
- “reliable systems”

---

## 🚫 What to Avoid

- Don’t say you “fell into” data engineering or that it was just convenience — that sounds passive.
- Avoid jargon-only answers (too many tool names back-to-back). Use tools to support impact.

## 💡 Likely Follow-Ups + Quick Answers

**Q: “What part of the stack do you enjoy most?”**  
A: “I enjoy the touchpoints between infra and data model — ensuring the platform is reliable, then enabling analysts to use it. That’s where SRE+data engineering meet.” *(short, confident)*

**Q: “Any moment you felt particularly proud?”**  
A: “When ZDART went live with parity and minimal disruption — analysts could trust numbers immediately. That felt like the whole point of the job.” *(smile, soft pause)*

### 🎯 INTRO (30 sec)

*(Warm tone, smile while starting)*

> “Let’s start with a question I really enjoy answering…  
> What motivated me to become a data engineer, and why I chose this path.”

### 🗣️ Main Script (~5 minutes total)

> “Early in my career, I was surrounded by reports — spreadsheets that didn’t match, dashboards with slightly different numbers, and analysts constantly cross-checking data.  
> *(pause)*  
> It was frustrating, but it made me curious.  
> *(gentle laugh tone)*  
> I realized the real issue wasn’t the people… it was the plumbing — the flow of data underneath.  
> *(pause 1 beat)*
>
> That curiosity pushed me toward learning how to fix the pipelines themselves.  
> *(steady tone)*  
> I started exploring ETL concepts, cloud platforms, and automation.  
> *(tiny pause)*
>
> My first major opportunity came when I worked on **ZDART**, which stood for Zebra Data & Reporting Transformation.  
> *(say “ZDART” with clarity, slower)*  
> It was a full on-prem to cloud migration — moving from Oracle Analytics Cloud to GCP and Databricks.  
> *(short pause)*
>
> In that project, I got to work on everything from **data validation**, to building **CI/CD pipelines** in GitHub Actions, to defining **access workflows** through Terraform and IAM.  
> *(slight rise in tone — you’re listing accomplishments)*  
> And that’s when it clicked for me — I wasn’t just moving data.  
> *(pause, drop tone)*  
> I was engineering reliability. I was helping business teams trust their numbers again.  
> *(pause 0.8s — let the weight of “trust” sit)*
>
> From there, I kept gravitating toward projects where **data quality, scalability, and reliability** came together — like the SRE and observability work I did.  
> *(steady tone)*  
> In that project, I collected telemetry from Airflow, Databricks, and ServiceNow, built a centralized monitoring layer in BigQuery, and visualized incidents in Power BI.  
> *(pause)*
>
> Seeing an alert fire automatically, and watching an incident resolve faster — that immediate feedback — that’s what keeps me excited about this field.  
> *(warm, inspired tone)*
>
> What motivates me now is the blend of **engineering discipline and business impact**.  
> *(say clearly, pause 0.5s)*  
> I love the challenge of making systems more reliable, more efficient, and more transparent — because it lets people make better decisions, faster.  
> *(drop tone slightly, confident finish)*
>
> So in short, I became a data engineer because it sits right at the intersection of **reliability, scalability, and business trust** — three things that define how I like to work.  
> *(pause 1s)*
>
> *(Smile slightly, take a breath.)*  
> “Would you like me to share a specific example from that ZDART migration or the observability initiative?”  
> *(This line is your smooth transition cue if the interviewer asks to go deeper.)*

### 🎧 COACHING CUES

- **First 30 seconds:** Storytelling tone, conversational.
- **ZDART mention:** Strong, slower — that’s your credibility moment.
- **“Engineering reliability” line:** Drop voice slightly to sound authoritative.
- **When mentioning tools (Databricks, GCP, Terraform):** Quick, clear, don’t over-enunciate.
- **Always smile before saying “what motivates me now…”** — it changes vocal warmth.
